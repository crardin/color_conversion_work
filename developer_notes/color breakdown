color breakdown

input file
xf fix check on input file to check for unique number field

output
- rounded lab values
	- one cell
	x check to see if I already have a function to do this
	*g add this data to the output table
- Original Munsell
	*f write function to take Munsell values and create this value
- Nominal H1
	- found from rounding the Munsell value to nearest node
	- 2.5, 5, 7.5, or 10
	xf write function to round to closest of those values
- Nominal H2
	- round to the nearest node
	xf not sure if I need another function to do this
- Nominal V
	- round Munsell to nearest node
	- whole number from 1 to 10
	xf not sure if I need another function for this
- Nominal H1 is listed twice ?
	xf write function to round chroma below 0.5 to "Ns"
	xf write function to round chroma between 0.5 to 1.5 as 1
	xf write function to round higher chromas (>1.5) to nearest even number
- Nominal Munsell
	- same as Nominal H above 
	- uses the Nominal values as input?
	- not sure what is needed here
	*f add function to find nominal munsell from full munsell value?
	*g add this data to the output table
- dE to Node
	- quantifies how close the Munsell value and the Nominal munsell value is
	*f write a function to determine dE
	*g add functionality to display this value
- Nominal Decimal Hue
	*f write function to convert color value to decimal value
	*f write function to create this value from the Nominal Munsell value
	*g add this data to the output table
- 40 Hue
	*f write function to calculate this
		- divide dE by 2.5 and round to the nearest whole number
		- neutrals are -1
- Munsell verbal description
	- converts Nominal Munsell into a verbal description
	*f write function to calculate the verbal description
		- format "[value], [chroma], [hue]"
		- Value
			- 1-2 	"very dark"
			- 3 	"dark"
			- 4-6 	"middle"
			- 7-8 	"light"
			- 9-10 	"very light"
		- Chroma
			- 0 just say 	"a [dark/middle/light] neutral"
			- 1 			"very weak"
			- 2-4			"weak"
			- 6-8			"moderate"
			- 12 or higher	"very strong"
		- Hue
			- write function that draws in HueVerbalsTable
			- add functionality of changing HueVerbalsTable
		- example:
			- 2.5 5/8 becomes a middle, moderate purplish red
	*g add this data to the output table
- Judd category
	*f write function that pulls in data from spreadsheet
	*g add functionality of changing Judd spreadsheet?
	*f write function that uses dE calculation to determine which "centroid" is the closest match for this color
	*f write function that uses original munsell to determine the category ID in this column
	*f write function to determine the Judd verbal description from the spreadsheet
	*g add this data to the output table
- RGB 
	*f write function to convert Nominal Munsell to RGB
		- make sure it's sRGB
	*g add this data to the output table
- Hex
	*f convert RGB value to the hex code
	*g add this data to the output table

GUI
	*g finish single color conversion page
	*g add in visualization of colors to the page
	*g delete output file line
	*g change button to open output file select box
	*f finish single_conversion class implementation
Design
	xs draw up class design
	xs fix classes
		xs add in classes for different parts of the Munsell color
		xs add in classes to deal with file input/output
	xs determine where to put in new function definitions
	xs plan out testing locations
	xt implement testing for main classes
	*f refactor to new design
	
Testing
	xt set up basic testing on the application
	xta figure out if testing dorks the app generation process

Deployment
	*a figure out if it's possible to script the App generation process
	*a fix download to/from github
	*a figure out scripting command line commands
