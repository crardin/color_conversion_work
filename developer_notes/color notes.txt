color model : an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers (RGB or CMYK)
absolute color space:
    - a color space in which the perceptual difference between colors is directly related to distances between colors as represented by points in the color space
    - a color space in which colors are unambiguous, that is, where the interpretations of colors in the space are colorimetrically defined without reference to external factors.
gamut: a specific mapping function between a color model and a reference color space
color space: specific organization of colors.

lab color space:
    - describes mathematically all perceivable colors in the three dimensions L for lightness and a and b for the color opponents green-red and blue-yellow.
    - 3 dimensional real number space
    - usually mapped onto a three-dimensional integer space for device-independent digital representation
    - darkest black at L=0, brightest white at L=100
    - a,b values represent true neutral gray values at a=0, b=0

UP Lab:
    - all colors of constant munsell hue have the same UP Lab hue angle, i.e. all the colors of the same Munsell hue designation will lie on a half-plane passing through the neutral axis
    - all Munsell hues are evenly distributed around the hue wheel.  Since there are 40 different hues in the Munsell set, there is a nine-degree angle between any adjacent pair of Munsell hues (360/9)
    - All colors of constant Munsell chroma (saturation) lie the same distance from the neutral axis, i.e. they have the same chroma in UP Lab space
        - chroma rings are perfect circles, centered on neutral
        - when taken collectively at different lightness values, all colors of constant chroma lie on the surface of a circular cylinder parallel to, and centered along the neutral axis
        - all chroma rings are equally spaced, there is a 5{delta}E (per Munsell chroma unit) spacing between adjacent Munsell chroma rings

to adapt Illuminant C to D50 use the Bradford chromatic adaptation algorithm

Bradford chromatic adaption algorithm:
    - newest and considered "best" by experts

QUESTIONS:
- if the original data was done using Illuminant C do we have to transform to alternate (i.e. modern) illuminants before doing any conversion?
- what is the difference between illuminant and chroma exactly?
    - if something was illuminated more wouldn't it appear brighter?
    - even if only a little?
