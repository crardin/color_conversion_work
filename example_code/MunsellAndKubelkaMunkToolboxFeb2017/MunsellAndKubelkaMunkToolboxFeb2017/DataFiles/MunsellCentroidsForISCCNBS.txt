Description:  
In 1955, the Inter-Society Color Council (ISCC) and the US National Bureau of Standards 
(NBS) (now called NIST) produced the ISCC-NBS colour naming system [Kelly1976].  This
system expresses common verbal colour descriptions, such as "light purplish pink," in 
terms of the Munsell system [Newhall1943].  Terms such as "light purplish pink" encompass
a multitude of distinguishable colours.  In fact, any Munsell colour whose hue is between
9P and 9RP, whose value is greater than 7.5, and whose chroma is between 5 and 9, would
be considered a light purplish pink.  

The ISCC-NBS system formalizes such relationships.  It gives colour names at three
increasing levels of precision.  In Level 1, a colour is designated very broadly, using
one of 13 common names (pink, red, orange, brown, yellow, olive, yellow green, green,
blue, purple, white, gray, or black).  This description is commonly understood, but only
approximate: there are many colours, for example, that would be called "red."  In Level 2,
16 intermediate colour names are added (yellowish pink, reddish orange, reddish brown,
orange yellow, yellowish brown, olive brown, greenish yellow, yellow green, olive green,
yellowish green, bluish green, greenish blue, purplish blue, reddish purple, purplish
pink, and purplish red).  Combining the 16 intermediate terms with the 13 original terms
from Level 1 gives a total of 29 Level 2 colour names.  Level 3 extends Level 2 by adding 
modifiers such as light, deep, grayish, vivid, etc.  In all, Level 3 contains 267 colour
names, and is the most detailed level of the ISCC-NBS system.  

Each Level 3 term is defined as a subset, or "block," of the Munsell system [Kelly1976].  
In 1958, [Kelly1958] calculated the centroid, in the Munsell system, of the block for each
Level 3 term.  The current file presents his results in a digital format, for use in
computer applications.  There are four columns of data.  The first three give the index
number, the Level 3 category name, and the Munsell centroid.  The fourth column specifies
whether a block is interior to the Munsell system (i.e. the block nowhere reaches the
MacAdam limits) or on its periphery (i.e. the block does reach the MacAdam limits
somewhere).  This distinction is important because different methods were used to calculate
the centroid in the two cases; see [Kelly1958] for details.  There is less confidence in
the accuracy of the peripheral centroids.  [Kelly1958] indicates the peripheral cases by
placing an asterisk after the centroids' Munsell coordinates.
